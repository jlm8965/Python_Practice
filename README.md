# Welcome to Python_Practice!
 
### Check out my code as I work my way through the "Python for Everybody" Specialization via Coursera! This Specialization is taught by Professor Charles Russell Severance, a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information.

### This Specialization contains five individual courses: 
1. ### Programming for Everybody (Getting started with Python)
2. ### Python Data Structures
3. ### Using Python to Access Web Data
4. ### Using Databases with Python
5. ### Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

### Each course covers multiple weeks with multiple assignments due each week. Follow along as I complete the assignments and complete the Specialization.
